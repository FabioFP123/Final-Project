                    <h3>The Animatronic</h3>
                    <p>We're thrilled to announce a shocking addition to our collection — the infamous Spring Bonnie
                        model,
                        once thought lost to time. After years of mystery surrounding the twisted history of Fredbear's
                        Family Diner and Freddy Fazbear's Pizzaria, we've unearthed the decrepit animatronic, and it’s
                        now part of our
                        one-of-a-kind, spine-chilling exhibit.
                        <br><br>
                        This eerie relic from the past, with its unsettling design and haunting backstory, will make
                        your heart race as you experience the fear it evokes firsthand.
                        <br><br>
                        Come face-to-face with the
                        nightmare, and witness the very animatronic that once was thought lost to time. It’s
                        the ultimate experience for horror enthusiasts—Fazbear's Fright is not for the faint of heart!

                    <h3>Security Office</h3>
                    <p>we’ve brought the darkest elements of our past to life, including our immersive security office
                        experience. As you enter, you’ll be greeted by our dedicated security guard, trapped in a
                        high-stakes battle for survival.
                        <br><br>
                        The security office is designed to make you feel like you’re
                        part of the action, with flickering lights, malfunctioning monitors, and a growing sense of
                        dread as the night wears on. Our security guard will guide you through the chaos, showcasing the
                        tension and fear that the original night guards endured while being stalked by the malevolent
                        animatronics.
                        <br><br>
                        You’ll experience firsthand the panic, the isolation, and the horror of
                        being
                        stuck in the office, trying to outlast the terror lurking in the shadows. It’s a truly
                        interactive nightmare—Fazbear's Fright will have you questioning what's real and what’s part of
                        the show.

                    <h3>The Vents</h3>
                    <p>Welcome to one of the most nerve-wracking features of Fazbear's Fright: The Horror Attraction—the
                        vent system! As you explore, you'll notice strategically placed cameras that give you a chilling
                        view of the eerie, darkened ventilation shafts where danger could be lurking at any moment.
                        <br><br>
                        These vents are more than just a part of the building’s architecture; they’re a vital part of
                        the nightmare. From the comfort of your viewing area in the security office, you’ll get a
                        front-row seat to the terrifying possibilities that lie within. Watch as the cameras flicker and
                        the shadows shift, knowing that at any moment, something could crawl through the vents, just
                        like in the stories.
                        <br><br>
                        The tension mounts as you monitor the screens, desperately trying to
                        predict where the terror will strike next. It’s a truly unsettling experience—Fazbear's Fright
                        lets you witness the horror in real time, but remember, it’s only a matter of time before it
                        becomes real for you, too.
